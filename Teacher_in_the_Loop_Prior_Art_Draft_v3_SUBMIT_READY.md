 Teacher in the Loop: Integrity-Resistant, Accommodation-Aligned AI Tutoring with Role-Scoped Transparency**Mode:** Prior-art design/specification paper (no deployment claims; enablement focus).

**Author Note at end regarding methodology and AI assistance.**

#

#

 AbstractWe present **Teacher in the Loop (TITL)**, a tutoring architecture designed to resist answer retrieval by default while preserving accessibility and auditability.

The system combines (i) **non-disclosive pasted-block detection** with instructional escalation and role-scoped notifications, (ii) an **answer-suppression guard** that withholds final answers unless unlocked by authorized roles, (iii) a **disability-aware accommodation engine** that binds accommodations to both pedagogy and interface, and (iv) a **role-based transparency log** with signed manifests.

We specify core modules, APIs, and logging schemas to enable independent implementation and to document novelty for prior-art purposes.**Keywords:** AI tutoring, academic integrity, special education, accessibility, FERPA, IDEA, transparency, prior art---

Introduction

#

#

#

 1.1 Problem StatementGeneral-purpose answer-retrieval tools make it trivial for students to obtain final answers without understanding.

Simultaneously, many tutoring systems treat accessibility and accommodations as optional add-ons rather than core design constraints.

Supervisors (teachers, guardians, administrators) often lack transparent, auditable views into what AI systems say or decide during instruction.

#

#

#

 1.2 Design GoalsTITL is designed to: (a) resist answer retrieval while encouraging reasoning, (b) support disability-aware accommodations without stigma or surveillance, (c) provide role-scoped transparency and audit trails, and (d) maintain student dignity through **non-disclosive** integrity handling.

#

#

#

 1.3 Contributions1.

**Non-disclosive pasted-block detection with instructional escalation and role-scoped logging.**  2.

**Answer-suppression guard** integrated into tutoring prompts and post-filters that withhold final answers by default, unlockable by authorized roles with audit trails.

3.

**Accommodation engine** that binds accommodations to both strategy selection and user interface; hooks for IEP goal mapping and progress notes.

4.

**Role-based transparency** via an append-only log with field-level redaction and signed manifests.

#

#

#

 1.4 Scope and Non-ClaimsThis document specifies methods and system components to enable implementation and to record prior art.

It does not claim deployment outcomes, clinical effectiveness, or comparative superiority.

Residual risks are documented in Section 13.---

#

#

 2.

System Overview

#

#

#

 2.1 Roles and Permissions- **Student:** interacts with the tutor; never sees integrity flags; can view learning artifacts and teacher feedback.  - **Teacher:** reviews transparency logs, receives integrity-verification prompts, unlocks final answers when appropriate.  - **Guardian:** receives summaries per policy; no live control.  - **Administrator:** configures policies, retention, and access scopes.

#

#

#

 2.2 Data FlowClient instrumentation emits privacy-filtered events to the TITL Orchestrator.

The Orchestrator computes comprehension signals, selects strategies, consults integrity policies, and calls the Tutoring Model.

Outputs and decisions are written to the Transparency Log.

Consoles render role-scoped views.

#

#

#

 2.3 Architectural PrinciplesPrevention-oriented integrity, least-privilege data handling, explainability through logs and signed manifests, accessibility as a first-class constraint.---

#

#

 3.

Architecture

#

#

#

 3.1 Client Instrumentation (Browser or Native)Captured signals: keystroke timing, `beforeinput`/`paste`, IME composition, STT segment timings, pointer/focus transitions.

Local buffering; privacy filters remove raw clipboard contents unless explicitly allowed for accessibility tooling.

```typescript// Minimal browser instrumentation (conceptual)const buf: any[] = [];function emit(type: string, payload: any) {  buf.push({ t: Date.now(), type, ...payload });}const el = document.querySelector('#student-answer') as HTMLTextAreaElement;el.addEventListener('beforeinput', (e: any) => emit('beforeinput', { inputType: e.inputType || null }));el.addEventListener('paste', (e: ClipboardEvent) => {  const txt = e.clipboardData?.getData('text') || '';  emit('paste', { length: txt.length });});el.addEventListener('compositionstart', () => emit('comp_start', {}));el.addEventListener('compositionend', (e: any) => emit('comp_end', { length: e.data?.length || 0 }));// STT hookfunction onSTTSegment(text: string, ms: number, conf: number) {  emit('stt', { length: text.length, dur_ms: ms, conf });}window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => navigator.sendBeacon('/telemetry', JSON.stringify(buf)));
```

#

#

#

 3.2 Orchestrator- **Comprehension scorer:** aggregates interaction signals and attempt features to a scalar `c∈[0,1]` plus diagnostic tags.  - **Strategy selector:** chooses from a Socratic library; consults accommodations to shape prompt style and UI.  - **Integrity policy engine:** evaluates paste/typed classifier outputs and thresholds; triggers verification strategies without disclosing to student.  - **Accommodation enforcer:** ensures UI and pedagogy changes are applied together; logs rationale.

#

#

#

 3.3 Tutoring Model InterfacePrompt patterns elicit reasoning and intermediate artifacts, not final answers.

Final answers require an explicit unlock token issued by a teacher action and recorded in the log.

#

#

#

 3.4 Transparency LoggerContent-addressed entries with per-entry salts; daily Merkle root; optional external anchoring.

Field-level redaction for role-scoped views.

See Section 7.

#

#

#

 3.5 ConsolesTeacher dashboard supports verification workflows and unlock decisions; guardian summaries emphasize growth and accommodations; admin console configures policies and retention.---

#

#

 4.

Integrity: Silent Detection & Instructional Escalation

#

#

#

 4.1 Threat ModelAdversaries may paste external LLM text, use a second device, run OCR on screenshots, collude with peers, or outsource to humans.

TITL focuses on **resistance and verifiable understanding**, not absolute prevention.

#

#

#

 4.2 Signals and Features- Explicit **paste** events with length; `beforeinput` types.  - **Burst-rate anomalies** and inter-keystroke timing variance.  - **Stylometric drift** vs a per-session baseline (character bigrams, function-word ratios, punctuation entropy).  - **STT/IME markers:** routed to non-penalizing paths.

#

#

#

 4.3 Classifier and ThresholdsOutputs: `TYPED`, `PASTE`, `LIKELY_PASTE`, `STT`, `IME`.

```python

#

 Conceptual classifierdef classify(seg):    if seg.event == 'paste': return 'PASTE'    if seg.event == 'stt': return 'STT'    if seg.event == 'comp_end' and seg.length > 12: return 'IME'    if seg.chars_in_100ms > 30 and seg.delta_mean < 25: return 'LIKELY_PASTE'    if seg.stylometry_shift > 0.85: return 'LIKELY_PASTE'    return 'TYPED'
```

#

#

#

 4.4 Non-Disclosive State Machine`observe → suspect → verify → confirm/clear`.

UI for the student is unchanged in `suspect/verify` states; only the orchestration swaps in verification-aligned prompts.

#

#

#

 4.5 Instructional Policy Ladder- Paraphrase-and-justify micro-prompts  - Stepwise reconstruction of solution path  - Brief oral explanation via STT  All paths maintain answer suppression.

Teacher may later unlock a final answer with audit logging.

#

#

#

 4.6 Privacy & FERPA AlignmentIntegrity events store minimal features with salts.

Notifications are role-scoped; students are not notified during sessions.

Retention and access scopes are policy-driven.---

#

#

 5.

Socratic Strategy Library & Answer-Suppression Guard

#

#

#

 5.1 Strategy TaxonomyElicit prior knowledge → plan micro-steps → targeted checks → reflect/generalize.

Strategies adapt wording, modality, and pacing per accommodations.

#

#

#

 5.2 Answer-Suppression Guard- For math, strip final numeric constants or closed forms using AST analysis; for code, stop generation at design steps.  - Templates instruct the model to generate scaffolds, not solutions; post-filters enforce no-answer policies.

```python

#

 Pseudocode for answer-suppression (math sketch)def guard_math(ast):    if ast.type == 'Equation' and ast.right.is_constant():        ast.right = Symbol('□')  

#

 suppress final constant    return ast

#

 Pseudocode for code guarddef guard_code(text):    sentinel = "

#

#

#

 Design stops here"    return text.split(sentinel)[0] + "\n[Answer locked — teacher unlock required]"
```

#

#

#

 5.3 Worked-Example SafetySome learners benefit from explicit modeling.

TITL supports **worked-example quotas** as an accommodation, logged with rationale to avoid misuse.---

#

#

 6.

Special Education Integration & Accommodation Engine

#

#

#

 6.1 Taxonomy- **Presentation:** font/contrast, TTS, simplified language, chunking.  - **Response:** speech input, multiple modalities, alternative formats.  - **Setting:** reduced distraction UI, focus timers, break cues.  - **Scheduling:** extended time, pacing adjustments.

#

#

#

 6.2 IEP MappingHooks for mapping tutoring activities to goals; progress notes with redaction for role-appropriate visibility.

#

#

#

 6.3 Condition-Aware PoliciesCondition-specific safeguards (e.g., ADHD, autism, dyslexia, processing disorders) to ensure Socratic pressure does not degrade accessibility.

#

#

#

 6.4 Logging of Accommodation RationaleEvery accommodation that changes strategy or UI emits a log entry with rationale and scope.---

#

#

 7.

Transparency & Role-Based Redaction

#

#

#

 7.1 Log Schema (conceptual)
```json{  "id": "sha256:...",  "ts": "2025-09-17T20:00:00Z",  "actor": "system|student|teacher",  "session": "abc123",  "event": "tutor_turn|integrity_flag|unlock|accommodation_change",  "fields": {    "prompt_hash": "sha256:...",    "output_hash": "sha256:...",    "integrity": {"class": "LIKELY_PASTE", "features": ["burst=42","shift=0.9"]},    "accommodations": ["tts","chunking"],    "decision": "switch_to_verification"  },  "role_redaction": {    "student": ["integrity","features"],    "teacher": [],    "guardian": ["features"],    "admin": []  },  "sig": "ed25519:..."}
```

#

#

#

 7.2 Signed ManifestsDaily Merkle roots; optional external anchoring for tamper evidence.

#

#

#

 7.3 Audit APIExport signed slices scoped by role; support dispute resolution and appeals.---

#

#

 8.

Implementation Details (Enablement)

#

#

#

 8.1 Core Module Pseudocode- Classifier (Section 4.3)  - Strategy selector interface
```pythonclass StrategySelector:    def choose(self, comprehension, tags, accommodations, integrity_class):        table = {            "default": "micro_steps",            "low_comprehension": "reteach_concept",            "verification_needed": "paraphrase_then_steps"        }        if integrity_class in ("PASTE","LIKELY_PASTE"):            return table["verification_needed"]        if comprehension < 0.3:            return table["low_comprehension"]        return table["default"]
```- Accommodation enforcement hooks

#

#

#

 8.2 Minimal API Surface- `POST /telemetry` → buffer of client events  - `POST /tutor` → {prompt, context, accommodations} → streaming scaffolds  - `POST /integrity/check` → features → {class, confidence, action}  - `GET /log/:scope` → role-redacted manifest slice

#

#

#

 8.3 Data Model**IEP Goal Object (example):**
```json{  "goal_id": "G-2025-ALG-01",  "student_id": "S-...",  "domain": "Algebra",  "target": "Solve linear equations with fractions",  "criteria": "Three consecutive sessions with ≥80% step correctness",  "accommodations": ["tts","extended_time","chunking"],  "review_cadence_days": 30}
```**Accommodation Policy Table (example):**
```json{  "policy_id": "ACC-ADHD-01",  "condition": "ADHD",  "ui": ["reduced_distraction","focus_timer","chunking"],  "pedagogy": ["micro_steps","explicit_checkpoints","worked_example_quota:1_per_unit"],  "rationale": "Sustain attention and reduce cognitive overload"}
```

#

#

#

 8.4 Security HardeningAuthentication, rate limits, replay protection; integrity of logs; operator access controls.---

#

#

 9.

Evaluation Plan (Simulation Only)This section defines how to evaluate TITL in simulation without claiming outcomes.

#

#

#

 9.1 Synthetic Profile Generation (Methods)- **Profiles:** generate distributions over grade level, reading level, and disability categories (e.g., ADHD, ASD, dyslexia, processing disorders).  - **Tasks:** sample from math word problems, reading comprehension, and short-answer reasoning tasks with annotated solution steps.  - **Accommodations:** assign per-profile accommodation sets drawn from the policy table.  - **Seeds & Reproducibility:** fix random seeds; publish config and prompts used for simulated tutors.

#

#

#

 9.2 Protocols (Methods)- **Baselines:** (a) generic tutor without answer suppression, (b) tutor with suppression only, (c) full TITL.  - **Integrity Scenarios:** inject external-paste events with varying lengths and stylometry shifts.  - **Verification Tasks:** require paraphrase and step reconstruction following detection.  - **Data:** publish synthetic data generation code and prompts for reproducibility.

#

#

#

 9.3 Metrics (Definitions)- **Verification success rate:** proportion of flagged sessions where the student can reconstruct reasoning satisfactorily.  - **False-flag rate:** fraction of sessions incorrectly flagged as paste in typed/STT/IME conditions.  - **Learning-gain proxy:** improvement in step correctness across a session.  - **Teacher time cost:** time required to review logs and unlock answers when appropriate.

#

#

#

 9.4 LimitationsSimulation cannot capture classroom dynamics or student intent; real-user studies under IRB are required for outcome claims.---

#

#

 10.

Fairness, Accessibility, and Safety

#

#

#

 10.1 Subgroup Analysis PlanMeasure verification success and false-flag rates across disability categories; evaluate calibration parity using expected-flag vs observed-flag curves per subgroup.

#

#

#

 10.2 Calibration & Error CostsPrefer instructional verification over punitive responses to mitigate harm from false positives.

#

#

#

 10.3 Appeal and OverrideDocument teacher override and student appeal pathways with auditable outcomes.---

#

#

 11.

Compliance & GovernanceIDEA/Section 504/FERPA alignment; role scopes; data minimization; retention schedule; deletion pathways.

#

#

 12.

Deployment & Operations (Generic)Standards-based LMS/SIS integration; observability; incident response; update policy; rate limiting; key management.---

#

#

 Appendix A — Method Claims (Plain-English)**A1.

Non-Disclosive Pasted-Block Detection with Instructional Escalation**  1) Capture client-side events (paste, IME, STT, timing).

2) Compute integrity class without altering student UI.

3) Emit role-scoped integrity event to an append-only log.

4) Switch to verification strategies (paraphrase, micro-steps, oral justification).

5) Maintain answer suppression; allow teacher unlock with audit.**A2.

Answer-Suppression Guard**  Withhold final answers via prompt discipline and post-filters; unlock gated by teacher action.**A3.

Accommodation Engine**  Map disability-aware needs to both UI and pedagogy; log rationale for changes.**A4.

Role-Scoped Transparency**  Append-only logging with field-level redaction; signed manifests; audit export API.

 Author NoteThis research was conducted as an independent investigation by a practitioner-researcher with ADHD.

AI tools were utilized as cognitive scaffolding to support organization, structure, and synthesis—demonstrating the same principles of AI-assisted learning advocated for students in this paper.

All conceptual innovations, system design, and strategic insights originated from the author’s analysis developed over **[X]** months of iterative research.
